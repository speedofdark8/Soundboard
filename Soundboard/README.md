# Soundboard
###### A customizable soundboard that listens for global hotkeys while not in focus

This idea was concocted while playing an online game that was fullscreen and had control of the mouse, leaving me unable to play funny or relevant sound clips for my friends to hear. 

The goal of this program is allow a user to launch it, add custom sounds and titles to the buttons on the GUI, and activate those buttons either on manual click or by using a global hotkey (CTRL + ALT + NumberKeys). When a (hot)key is pressed, the corresponding soundclip is played for all to hear.
